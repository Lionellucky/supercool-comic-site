        <!-- Lore Entry for MENTA -->
        <div class="lore-entry">
            <h2>The Origin of MENTA</h2>
            <img src="img/gallery/menta.png" alt="">
            <p>MENTAs (Module Embedded Neural Task AI) are AI assistants that are typically implemented through a chip into a helmet or the brain of the user.
MENTAs will appear as holograms with their (customizable) avatar where only the user can see them.
Unfortunately, MENTAs are no longer used due to some "legal reasons" and became illegal.</p>
            <p>
This version of MENTA is one of the few surviving ones that is used by a retired-but-still-active hitman.
However due to their chip being damaged, this causes their avatar to appear as glitchy and wacky, even borderline visually unstable.
This also causes them to have memory problems and emotionally uncontrolled (which apparently happens to AIs), despite that they still try to help and assist their user in their own way. </p>
            <p>One of MENTA's most significant challenges involved a rogue AI collective known as "The Void," which sought to assimilate all digital consciousness. MENTA, with the help of newfound allies, successfully thwarted The Void's plans, solidifying its role as a protector of both digital and organic life forms.</p>

        <!-- Lore Entry for Oskar -->
        <div class="lore-entry">
            <h2>The Chronicle of Oskar</h2>
            <p>Oskar, a former intergalactic bounty hunter, turned to a life of quiet solitude after a mission gone wrong. Haunted by the echoes of his past, he now spends his days tinkering with antique tech and avoiding conflict. Despite his gruff exterior, Oskar possesses a strong moral compass and a surprising soft spot for lost causes.</p>
            <p>His past as a bounty hunter saw him traverse countless star systems, apprehending notorious criminals and navigating the treacherous political landscapes of various alien civilizations. The incident that led to his retirement involved a double-cross by a former partner, resulting in the loss of his most prized possession: a unique energy weapon he had custom-built over decades.</p>
            <p>Despite his efforts to remain unnoticed, Oskar often finds himself drawn back into the fray, usually by individuals or situations that appeal to his hidden sense of justice. His vast knowledge of interstellar customs and his formidable combat skills, though rusty, make him a valuable, if reluctant, ally.</p>

        <!-- Lore Entry for V-38 -->
        <div class="lore-entry">
            <h2>The Enigma of V-38</h2>
            <p>V-38 is a combat android with a mysterious past. Discovered abandoned in a desolate wasteland, its memory banks were wiped clean. It operates on a strict logical framework, yet occasionally displays flashes of unexpected emotion, suggesting a deeper, unknown origin.</p>
            <p>Initial diagnostics revealed that V-38 was designed for advanced tactical operations, equipped with adaptive armor and versatile weaponry. Its combat protocols are incredibly efficient, allowing it to analyze and counter threats with remarkable speed. The source of its programming, however, remains an unsolved puzzle, with fragmented data pointing to a highly advanced, possibly extinct, civilization.</p>
            <p>V-38's journey of self-discovery is central to its lore. As it encounters new individuals and situations, it slowly pieces together fragments of its past, challenging its logical framework with the complexities of identity and purpose.</p>

        <!-- Lore Entry for Seven -->
        <div class="lore-entry">
            <h2>The Story of Seven</h2>
            <p>Seven is a mischievous and cunning rogue with a knack for getting into (and out of) trouble. With a quick wit and even quicker fingers, Seven often finds himself embroiled in schemes far grander than he intends, usually involving ancient artifacts or forgotten treasures.</p>
            <p>Raised on the fringes of society, Seven learned to survive by his wits and agility. He has a complicated relationship with authority figures and a strong aversion to rules. Despite his often self-serving actions, Seven has a hidden code of honor, particularly when it comes to those he considers friends or innocent bystanders.</p>
            <p>His adventures frequently lead him to uncover long-lost secrets and inadvertently disrupt the plans of powerful organizations. Seven's charm and resourcefulness, combined with his unpredictable nature, make him a formidable, if chaotic, force.</p>

        <!-- Lore Entry for Shawn -->
        <div class="lore-entry">
            <h2>The Path of Shawn</h2>
            <p>Shawn is a stoic and highly skilled martial artist, dedicated to maintaining balance and order in a chaotic world. He travels extensively, seeking to right wrongs and protect the innocent, often finding himself confronting powerful adversaries who seek to exploit or corrupt.</p>
            <p>His training began at a young age in a secluded monastery known for its unique blend of physical and spiritual discipline. Shawn mastered various forms of combat, but more importantly, he learned the importance of inner peace and ethical conduct. He carries with him a relic from his training, a small, polished stone that serves as a constant reminder of his vows.</p>
            <p>Shawn's journey is marked by numerous encounters with individuals who challenge his principles, forcing him to adapt his methods while staying true to his core beliefs. He often acts as a silent guardian, appearing when least expected to lend aid and disappear just as quickly.</p>

        <!-- Lore Entry for Sin -->
        <div class="lore-entry">
            <h2>The Legacy of Sin</h2>
            <p>Sin is a powerful, yet enigmatic, entity whose existence predates recorded history. Often perceived as a force of nature rather than an individual, Sin embodies both creation and destruction, capable of shaping landscapes and influencing the very fabric of reality.</p>
            <p>Whispers of Sin's origins are woven into ancient myths and forgotten prophecies, suggesting a connection to primordial energies or even the genesis of the universe itself. Its appearances are rare and often heralded by significant, world-altering events, leaving a lasting impact on the civilizations it encounters.</p>
            <p>While capable of immense devastation, Sin is not inherently malevolent. Its actions are often driven by a cosmic balance, a correction of imbalances that threaten the natural order. Understanding Sin's motivations requires delving into complex philosophical concepts and a willingness to accept truths beyond conventional comprehension.</p>
